# Latte
Introductory language meant to bring people into programming with a simplistic language designed with readability in mind.

## Quick information
### Extensions
There are a couple file extensions I named myself to organize and identify certain files for my use. If you're interested in forking or contributing, this may be of importance.
#### .in
Information of Latte. They're not really important in the grand scheme of running Latte, but it's a nice addition for making sure that you have the right version and the right configurations.
#### .lcfg
If you need to configure certain options of Latte, edit here. I've made these simple enough so that the average joe can edit it without breaking anything. Or, at least I hope so.
#### .ltp
Plugins for Latte. You should write them in Python for access to the inner workings of Latte, but if it's a simple function or such, use plain Latte.
#### .lt
Latte files
#### .lte
Latte example files (so I don't get mixed up when I make them, there's no difference from a .lt)
